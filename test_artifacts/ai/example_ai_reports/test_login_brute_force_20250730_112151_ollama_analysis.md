# ðŸ§  Ollama AI Healing Report

## Test Information
- **Test Name**: `test_login_brute_force`
- **Timestamp**: `20250730_112151`
- **Model Used**: `gemma2:2b`
- **URL**: `N/A`
- **Error Type**: `Unknown`

## Error Details
```
assert False
```

## Ollama Analysis
```
The test is failing due to a potential issue with the login form's handling of invalid input. The error message is visible, but it might not be clear what exactly caused the failure.  It's likely that the form is not correctly validating or processing the input data.
```

## Root Cause
```
Potential issues with the login form's validation logic or how it handles user input.
```

## Suggested Fix
```
Investigate the login form's code to identify potential errors in the validation logic and error handling.  Ensure that the form is correctly validating the email and password inputs and displaying appropriate error messages.
```

## Updated Code
```
```python
    # ... (rest of your test code) 

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_login_comprehensive_email_sql_injection(app):
        # ... (your existing test code)

        # Add more assertions to verify the form's behavior and error handling.
        assert await app.login_page.error_message_email_invalid.is_visible()
        assert await app.login_page.has_email_invalid_error_icon()
```
```

## Confidence Level
**80.0%**

## Recommendations
```
 - **Test Data:**  Use a more comprehensive test data set to cover various scenarios and potential attack vectors. This will help in identifying the root cause of failures. 
- **Logging:** Implement logging for critical events during the login process, including errors and warnings. This will provide valuable insights into what's happening during the test execution. 
- **Error Handling:**  Ensure that the application handles invalid input gracefully and provides clear error messages to the user. This helps in debugging and understanding the issue.
