# Playwright Python Test Setup & Usage

This guide explains how to set up and run Playwright-based Python tests with Allure reporting on **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**.

---

## Prerequisites

**All Platforms:**
- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for Playwright browser installation)
- [Allure Commandline](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_installing_a_commandline)
- [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) (for loading `.env` files)

**Windows Only:**
- [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

**macOS Only:**
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (recommended for installing Allure and Node.js)

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

---

## 2. Create Environment Files

Create the environment file(s) you need in the project root:

- `.env.dev` for development
- `.env.test` for test
- `.env.prod` for production

Each file should contain the environment variables your tests require, for example:

```
BASE_URL=https://your-base-url
API_LOGIN_URL=https://your-api-url
USER_EMAIL=pm@example.com
USER_PASSWORD=yourpassword
# ...and so on for all required variables
```
Alternately, these files should be available in your secrets server and may need to be customized for your tests.

---

## 3. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

**macOS/Linux:**

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scriptsctivate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

## 4. Install Python Dependencies

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements_with_versions.txt
```

Make sure your `requirements_with_versions.txt` includes `python-dotenv`:

```
python-dotenv
```

---

## 5. Install Playwright Browsers

```sh
python -m playwright install --with-deps
```

---

## 6. Install Allure Commandline

**macOS (with Homebrew):**

```sh
brew install allure
```

**Linux:**

```sh
sudo apt-get install default-jre
wget https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/releases/download/2.27.0/allure-2.27.0.tgz
tar -xzf allure-2.27.0.tgz
sudo mv allure-2.27.0 /opt/allure
sudo ln -s /opt/allure/bin/allure /usr/bin/allure
```

**Windows:**

- Download the [Allure zip](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/releases) and extract it.
- Add the `bin` folder to your `PATH` environment variable.
- Open a new terminal and run `allure --version` to verify.

---

## 7. Load Environment Variables Automatically

Add this to your `conftest.py` or at the top of your test entrypoint:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Choose the environment file you want to load
env_file = os.getenv("ENV_FILE", ".env.dev")
load_dotenv(dotenv_path=env_file)
```

You can set the `ENV_FILE` environment variable to switch between `.env.dev`, `.env.test`, or `.env.prod`.

**Example:**

```sh
ENV_FILE=.env.test pytest ...
```

---

## 8. Run the Tests

Run your tests with pytest. For example, to run smoke tests with Allure reporting, reruns and in parallel:

```sh
pytest --alluredir=allure-results --capture=tee-sys --reruns 2 --reruns-delay 5 -m smoke -n auto
```

- Adjust the `-m smoke` marker or other pytest options as needed.

You can also pass env vars on the commandline, for example if you want headed tests or a different browser.

```sh
BROWSER=firefox HEADLESS=false pytest --alluredir=allure-results --capture=tee-sys --reruns 2 --reruns-delay 5 -m smoke -n auto
```

Adjust as needed.

---

## 9. Generate the Allure Report

```sh
allure generate allure-results -o allure-report --clean --single-file
```

---

## 10. View the Allure Report

**macOS:**

```sh
open allure-report/index.html
```

**Linux:**

```sh
xdg-open allure-report/index.html
```

**Windows:**

Open `allure-report\index.html` in your browser.

---

## 11. Github Actions

Everything is already configured to run a smoke test, then if that passes it will run the full 'login' test suite. All secrets are configured on the repo level, so if you add any, you will need to update the config.

---


## 12. AI Self healing

Install Ollama Python library

```sh
pip install ollama
```

# Ollama Model Setup for AI Healing

**Check Available Models**

```sh
ollama list
```

**Pull a Suitable Model**

### For vision + text analysis (recommended for screenshot analysis):

```sh
ollama pull llava:7b
# or
ollama pull llava:13b
```

### For text-only analysis (faster, smaller):

```sh
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
# or
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

**Update Your Environment Variable**

Set the model you actually have:

```sh
export OLLAMA_MODEL=llava:7b
# or whatever model you pulled
```

**Test Ollama is Working**

```sh
ollama run llava:7b "Hello, can you analyze test failures?"
```

This is not configured on Github Actions due to needing a larger machine runner.
Reports will be found in /ai_healing_reports

To see this in action, you can run a test specifically created to show it in action by running
```sh
AI_HEALING_ENABLED=true ENV=dev SKIP_SCREENSHOTS=0 HEADLESS=false pytest --alluredir=allure-results --capture=tee-sys --reruns 2 --reruns-delay 5 -m trigger_ai_healing
```

This is an example of commandline output

```sh

## 12. BrowserStack Integration

You can run your Playwright tests on real browsers in the cloud using [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/). This is useful for cross-browser and cross-OS testing without maintaining your own infrastructure.

### 1. Prerequisites

- You must have a [BrowserStack account](https://www.browserstack.com/users/sign_up).
- Your account's **Username** and **Access Key** (found in your BrowserStack dashboard).

### 2. Install Required Python Package

Install the BrowserStack Local Python bindings:

```sh
pip install browserstack-local
```

### 3. Set BrowserStack Credentials

Add the following to your `.env.dev` (or relevant `.env` file):

```
BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=your_browserstack_username
BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=your_browserstack_access_key
BROWSERSTACK_ENABLED=true
```

> **Note:** Set `BROWSERSTACK_ENABLED=false` to run tests locally.

### 4. How It Works

When `BROWSERSTACK_ENABLED=true`, the test runner will:
- Connect to BrowserStack using your credentials.
- Launch the specified browser/OS in the cloud.
- Run your Playwright tests remotely.

When `BROWSERSTACK_ENABLED=false`, tests run locally as usual.

### 5. Running Tests on BrowserStack

Activate your virtual environment and run:

```sh
BROWSERSTACK_ENABLED=true pytest --alluredir=allure-results
```

You can also set the environment variable in your `.env.dev` file.

### 6. Customizing Browser/OS

Edit the capabilities in the `conftest.py` file under the `caps` dictionary to change browser, version, OS, etc. Example:

```python
caps = {
    "browser": "chrome",
    "browser_version": "latest",
    "os": "osx",
    "os_version": "sonoma",
    "name": "Playwright Test",
    "build": "playwright-python-build-1",
    "browserstack.username": os.getenv("BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME"),
    "browserstack.accessKey": os.getenv("BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY"),
}
```

See [BrowserStack Playwright Capabilities](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/playwright/python#capabilities) for more options.

### 7. Viewing Results

- Test results and screenshots will be available in your BrowserStack dashboard.
- Allure reports will still be generated locally if you use `--alluredir`.

---

**Tip:**  
You can switch between local and BrowserStack runs by toggling the `BROWSERSTACK_ENABLED` variable, without changing your test code.

**Regenerate Docs for LLMs:**  
This project makes use of OneFileLLM: https://github.com/jimmc414/onefilellm

To install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jimmc414/onefilellm.git
cd onefilellm
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

For GitHub API access (recommended):
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"
```

To regenerate output.xml:
```python
python onefilellm.py https://github.com/philmcneely/PythonPlaywright_Hudl
```

You can also run the script against a local repository by providing the local path instead of a GitHub URL, for example:
```python
python onefilellm.py /path/to/your/local/repo
---


## Troubleshooting

- **Missing .env file:**  
  Make sure you have created the correct `.env.<env>` file with all required variables.
- **Virtual environment activation issues:**  
  Double-check the activation command for your OS and shell.
- **Allure not found:**  
  Ensure Allure is installed and available in your `PATH`.
- **Windows build errors:**  
  Install the Visual C++ Build Tools as described above.
